# hello-world
In order to learn the use of GitHub, and possibly unburden my brain of floatsome, I intend to dump some content here.

If you're reading this it is probably because you have some professional interest in my work.

I, Deacon Rodda, am – professionally speaking – a designer first, and a programmer, like, 14th. In an official capacity I studied fine art, writing, and business. My first entry into commercial aesthetic service was when a friend dropped a screen printing press on me because he couldn't move with it. That was in 2005. I had never done any meaningful commercial art or graphic design. I began silk screening shirts for punk and indie bands, because with the limited exposure to print making that I had from art school I could meet those standards right away.
